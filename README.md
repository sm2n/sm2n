I have a background in mathematics, but mostly spend my time programming. I'm mainly interested in programming language design and implementation. My main code forge is sourcehut, not github, so [that's](https://git.sr.ht/~sm2n/) where you'll find my projects.

Currently:
- I'm learning how to use SMT Solvers
- I'm learning Haskell and Rust
- Writing a [library](https://git.sr.ht/~sm2n/streamscl) for lazy sequences with stream fusion in Common Lisp
